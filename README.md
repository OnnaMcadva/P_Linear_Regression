# P_Linear_Regression

This repository contains a simple educational project that demonstrates the basic principles of linear regression. The main goal of this project is to help beginners understand how linear regression works, both from a theoretical and practical point of view.

## Overview

Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in statistics and machine learning. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

This project provides a clear and straightforward implementation of linear regression, ideal for students and anyone who wants to learn the basics.

## Features

- Step-by-step implementation of linear regression from scratch
- Well-commented code for easy understanding
- Example datasets for practice
- Visualizations to illustrate results (if applicable)
- Explanatory documentation and comments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of Python and mathematics (algebra)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OnnaMcadva/P_Linear_Regression.git
   ```

2. (Optional) Install required libraries if used:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the main script (e.g., `main.py` or `linear_regression.py`) in your preferred IDE or text editor.
2. Run the script to see how linear regression is implemented and tested on example data.
3. Review the code comments and explanations to deepen your understanding.
